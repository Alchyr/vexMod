    // DO NOT HARDCODE YOUR STRINGS ANYWHERE, it's really bad practice to have "Strings" in your code:

    /*
     * 1. It's bad for if somebody likes your mod enough (or if you decide) to translate it.
     * Having only the JSON files for translation rather than 15 different instances of "Dexterity" in some random cards is A LOT easier.
     *
     * 2. You don't have a centralised file for all strings for easy proof-reading. If you ever want to change a string
     * you don't have to go through all your files individually/pray that a mass-replace doesn't screw something up.
     *
     * 3. Without hardcoded strings, editing a string doesn't require a compile, saving you time (unless you clean+package).
