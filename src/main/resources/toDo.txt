1. Finish Blaze Beam Action. Consider making only Buffs
2. Add new cards
3. Event - Infernal Sword - At the start of each combat, add a random Attack to your hand. It costs 0 this turn.
4. Consider implementation of specific description dialogues depending on Sword generation.
5. Begin Voice Box work.
6. Test cards
7. Bug fixes I guess....
8. Consider making new VFX for some cards. Idea: Orbs firing little shapes with SharpOrbs.
